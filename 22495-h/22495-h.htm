<h1>THE NEW PUN BOOK</h1>

<h3>COLLECTED, EDITED AND ARRANGED FROM<br />
THE NOTES OF TWO LEARNED PUNDITS</h3>

<br />

<h4>Who thought they never saw the Punjab delighted in<br />
all pungencies of speech. Scholarly men who rejoice<br />
in punctiliousness in their language, contrive to<br />
improve its flavor and precision by exercise in<br />
these unexpected juxtapositions. Thus, as<br />
with our Pundit's famous countryman Mr.<br />
Jaberjee, though they use the purest<br />
language, they can instantly express<br />
every shade of thought with grace<br />
and completeness without resorting<br />
to slang:&mdash;that ready cloak<br />
wherewith puny minds strive<br />
to cover their vulgarity<br />
and lack of culture.</h4>

<p>"He's a professional grafter."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The nurseryman."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"You know Fatty Schultz the butcher. What do you suppose he
weighs?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, what does he weigh?"</p>

<p>"Meat."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"I saw a sign in a hardware store to-day 'Cast iron sinks.' As
though everyone wasn't wise to that."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"How are you to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't kick."</p>

<p>"Thought you were ill."</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;I have the gout."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Let me see," said the minister, who was filling out the marriage
certificate and had forgotten the date, "this is the fifth, is it
not?"</p>

<p>"No, sir!" said the bride, with some indignation, "this is only
my third!"</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>She&mdash;I had a $5 bill in this dictionary yesterday and I can't
find it anywhere.</p>

<p>He&mdash;Did you look among the Vs, dear?</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Have you ever met my sister, Louisa?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She's rather stout, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"I have another at home&mdash;Lena."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Why do you call that colored man a blackmailer."</p>

<p>"Because he is employed at the post-office. And that ain't the
worst of it."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; his wife takes hush money."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"I do. She's a child nurse."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>I hear they are trying to close up the gambling establishments in
New York. Why didn't they close up Adam? He was the first
gambler. Didn't he start the races?</p>

<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>"Gee, I just made a bad break," murmured the chef, as he threw
away some rotten eggs.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"This is our latest novelty," said the manufacturer, proudly.
"Good work, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not bad," replied the visitor, "but you can't hold a candle to
the goods we make."</p>

<p>"Oh! are you in this line, too?"</p>

<p>"No. We make gunpowder."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>You ought to sleep well, You lie so easily!</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"My girl's father is an undertaker. He has invented an automobile
hearse. Folks are just dying to ride in it."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"An Irishman comes to this country, remains here ten years, and
goes back to Ireland and dies. What is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, an Irishman, of course."</p>

<p>"No, you're wrong; he is a corpse."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>He&mdash;Why has he put her picture in his watch?</p>

<p>She&mdash;Because he thinks she will love him in time.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>"I saw some delicious apples growing on a tree this morning. I
couldn't reach them, and asked the lady of the house if she would
let me take a step-ladder."</p>

<p>"Did she give it to you?"</p>

<p>"No; but she gave me a stare."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"My sister had a fright yesterday. She had a black spider run up
her arm."</p>

<p>"That's nothing. I had a sewing machine run up the seam of my
trousers."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>Attorney for the Defense&mdash;Have you ever been cross-examined
before?</p>

<p>The Witness&mdash;Have I. I'm a married man.&mdash;Life.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>&mdash;I met a deaf and dumb man to-day who had every joint of his
fingers broken.</p>

<p>&mdash;That is terrible, how did it happen?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, he used to crack jokes on his fingers.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"I'm nearly starved. Just got in from a three-hour trip on the
New York Central."</p>

<p>"But couldn't you get anything to eat on the train?"</p>

<p>"Nope! It was a 'fast' train."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>"What do you think of the statement that there are three hundred
haunted houses in New York?" asked Mr. Knickerbocker.</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Jones, "that only ghost to show how plentiful
spirits are here."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"I saw a big rat in my cook-stove and when I went for my revolver
he ran out."</p>

<p>"Did you shoot him?"</p>

<p>"No. He was out of my range."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Greene</span>&mdash;"These wakes of yours are pretty boisterous
affairs sometimes."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Finnegan</span>&mdash;"Av coarse! Sure, we hav' t' make a great
noise t' wake the dead."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"I see Dorkins has got all of his seven daughters married off."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he took advantage of his official position to effect
it."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"Why, he is chairman of the board of public works and he
advertised for proposals."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Are your folks well to do?"</p>

<p>"No. They're hard to do."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>"If you should die, what would you do with your body?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I'd sell mine to a medical student."</p>

<p>"Then you'd be giving yourself dead away."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"I was at the track to-day, Percy, and there was a horse down
there with the itch. He came up to the post, and they scratched
him."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">He</span>&mdash;"Yes, she is living under an assumed name."</p>

<p><span class="sc">She</span>&mdash;"Horrible! What is it?"</p>

<p><span class="sc">He</span>&mdash;"The one she assumed immediately after her husband
married her!"</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Biggs</span>&mdash;"I hear the jail was afire this morning?"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Baggs</span>&mdash;"Naw; it was only a sell."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>Love they say is blind. Well: if so marriage must be an
eye-opener.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"It doesn't do any good to scold the janitor about our cold
rooms."</p>

<p>"Yes, it does. I get all warmed up when I talk to him."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>"This liver is awful, Maud," said Mr. Newwed.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," returned the bride, "I'll tell the cook to
speak to the livery-man about it."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Who was the first one that came from the ark when it landed."</p>

<p>"Noah."</p>

<p>"You are wrong. Don't the good book tell us that Noah came forth?
So there must have been three ahead of him."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Railway Clerk</span>&mdash;Another accident on the road to-day, sir.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Manager</span>&mdash;Indeed; What now?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Clerk</span>&mdash;Man dislocated his neck trying to read our new
time table.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"I got your fare, didn't I?" asked the conductor.</p>

<p>"I believe not," the facetious passenger replied. "I think I saw
you ring it up."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Isaacs</span>&mdash;Undt suppose dey did send us a message from
Mars, how could dey tell if we got it?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Cohen</span>&mdash;Vell, dey mighd send it gollect undt see if ve
paid for it.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><span class="sc">He</span>&mdash;I'll go to-morrow and buy a diamond engagement ring.</p>

<p><span class="sc">She</span>&mdash;Now, George, for the first time your talk has the
true ring in it.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"I am told," said she, saucily, "that though you are a military
man, you are afraid of powder."</p>

<p>"To prove that the assertion is calumnious," replied he, "I have
only to do this."</p>

<p>Whereupon he lightly kissed her on the cheek, and his lips showed
that he was not.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Pendergast</span> (in disgust)&mdash;You call these shades
alike! Is there anything you can match?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. Pendergast</span>&mdash;Yes. Pennies.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>Pressed for work&mdash;cider.</p>

<p>Never out of print&mdash;the calico counter.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Is this a fire insurance office?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; can we write you some insurance?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can. You see, my employer threatens to fire me next
Saturday, and I'd like some protection."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>"We should never complain, whatever may befall us," said the
minister. "The moment we grow dissatisfied we become unhappy."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" she sighed.</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the good man; "the first woman who complained of
her Lot, was turned into a pillar of salt."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Tommy," said mamma, tearfully, "it gives me as much pain as it
does you to punish you."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Tommy</span> (also tearfully)&mdash;Mebbe it does, but not in the
same place.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"I'll never ask another woman to marry me as long as I live!"</p>

<p>"Refused again?"</p>

<p>"No; accepted."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>A wag who thought to have a joke at the expense of an Irish
provision dealer said, "Can you supply me with a yard of pork?"</p>

<p>"Pat," said the dealer to his assistant, "give this gentleman
three pig's feet."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"They say corporations have no soul."</p>

<p>"How about the Shoe Trust."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>"Did your sweetheart receive you warmly last night?" asked one
Pittsburg young man of another.</p>

<p>"No, but her father did."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"He fired me."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Permit me, then, to die at your feet!" he cried desperately.</p>

<p>She shivered.</p>

<p>"I see no objection to that," she answered. "All papa said was
that you mustn't hang around here."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>Don't doubt the veteran who tells you he was always where the
bullets were thickest; perhaps he was hiding under the ammunition
wagon.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Mr. Bixby</span>&mdash;Have you noticed how much better I rest after
a day's fishing?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Bixby</span>&mdash;No; but I have noticed how much easier you
lie after a day's fishing than upon other days.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Nature never allows anything to run to waist."</p>

<p>"Humph! You've never seen a Vermont girl of forty."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>"What's the matter here?"</p>

<p>"Man broke his neck."</p>

<p>"What story did he fall from?"</p>

<p>"Didn't fall&mdash;tried to see the top of the building."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>According to a florist's magazine "Jacks are becoming cheap."
This may be true, but we have known men who would have been
willing to pay $10 for one to put with the two already in their
hands.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Johnny</span>&mdash;What makes you look so tired?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Tommy</span>&mdash;My step-mother is sick end now I'll get licked
before every meal. The doctor says she must take exercise on an
empty stomach.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Brown</span>&mdash;"Peckhen has arrived safe. I just received a
cablegram from him."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span>&mdash;"Did he have a rough voyage?"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brown</span>&mdash;"No; his wife didn't go."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Oh, live and let live, my man."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd look well, wouldn't I? I'm a butcher."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><span class="sc">Smith</span>&mdash;I notice that Robinson has an article in the
paper this morning.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jones</span>&mdash;Indeed! I didn't see it. What was it?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Smith</span>&mdash;His spring overcoat. He was taking it to the
tailor to be pressed and cleaned.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>When Lot found his wife transformed into a pillar of salt, he was
wise enough to let it go at that and not take a fresh one.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Soloman Soloman</span>&mdash;Our frent Cohen must pe goin' t' haf a

<p><span class="sc">Isaac Isaacs</span>&mdash;Vy?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Soloman Soloman</span>&mdash;Vell, he took oud an inshoorance bolicy
yeste'day.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"A telephone girl always reminds me of a pictured saint."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"There is a continual 'hello' around her head."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>A husband and wife are considered one, but it is useless to try
to work that gag on the landlord when he presents the board bill.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>"You haven't a cent, and yet wish to marry Miss Bilyan. Don't you
expect her father to kick you out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no I intend to go before the footlights."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class="sc">Young M.D.</span>&mdash;That jig is up.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Old M.D.</span>&mdash;What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Young M.D.</span>&mdash;That fellow with St. Vitus's dance died this
morning.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Do you think that as a rule people who attend theaters are
superstitious?"</p>

<p>"Do I think so? I know it. I have seen people sit for an hour
waiting for a ghost to walk."</p>

<p>"For that matter the actors themselves often wait longer than
that."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Here's an account of a hen which layed three eggs at once, and
then died," remarked Mrs. Sumway.</p>

<p>"From over-eggsertion, probably," commented her husband.</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"What is the best way to raise cabbage?"</p>

<p>"With a knife and fork."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>"Why is Miss B&mdash;&mdash; wearing black?"</p>

<p>"She is in mourning for her husband."</p>

<p>"Why, she never had a husband!"</p>

<p>"No, that is why she mourns."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"Dearest," she murmured, "I'm so afraid you'll change."</p>

<p>"Darling," he answered, "you'll never find any change about me."</p>

<hr />
<br />

<p>"What's the matter here?" asked a stranger of a small boy, as he

<br />

<p>"He has none of the finer sensibilities, nothing to distinguish
him from the common herd."</p>

<p>Jenks&mdash;in self-defence?</p>

<p>Wise&mdash;Yes; if I hadn't laughed so he would have repeated the
thing, thinking I hadn't seen the point.</p>

<p>There is as much strength in an egg as in a pound of meat.</p>
